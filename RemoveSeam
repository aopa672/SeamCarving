% RemoveSeam
% Removes one pixel from each row from an image and gives a output without
% the pixels which formed a seam of the lowest energy, through the image
% Author: Asel Opata

% Inputs :   imageData - A m × n × 3 array of uint8 values (unsigned 8
%                        bit image) representing an RGB image
%                 seam - A 1D array representing column coordinates, of
%                        seam pixels in each rowdescribing the path of a
%                        minimum energy vertical from row 1 to the last row
% Output : seamedimage - A m × (n - 1) × 3 array of uint8 values a
%                        representing an image with the seam removed
%                        (unsigned 8 bit integers)

function[seamedData] = RemoveSeam(imageData, seam)
% Find dimensions of image data
[rows, ~, ~] = size(imageData);
% Store each new row created minus seam pixel in seamedData array
for seamrownumber = 1:rows
    seamedData(seamrownumber,:,:) = RemovePixelFromRow(imageData(seamrownumber,:,:),seam(seamrownumber));
